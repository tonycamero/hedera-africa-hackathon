# TrustMesh Issuer Desktop Application - Complete Vision Document

**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: October 2025  
**Purpose**: Baseline guide for building professional desktop tools for institutional token issuers

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

The **TrustMesh Issuer Desktop App** is a professional-grade application designed for institutions that need to issue recognition tokens, civic credits, and trust-based assets at scale. While students, employees, and citizens interact with TrustMesh through viral web/mobile apps, issuers require enterprise-level tools for bulk operations, compliance, and institutional integration.

**Core Vision**: Bridge the gap between institutional adoption needs and consumer viral growth by providing each user type with purpose-built interfaces while maintaining shared HCS-compliant backend infrastructure.
