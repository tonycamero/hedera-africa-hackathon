## 📦 What Was Built

### 1. Token-Gated Mode System (Phase 2-3)
**Commit:** `c585eed` - feat: token-gated lenses Phase 2-3

**Core Architecture:**
- **4 Token-Gated Modes:** VIP, Civic Leader, Collector, Premium
- **Mode Detection Logic:** Priority-based unlock system (VIP > Civic Leader/Premium > Collector > App)
- **8 Total Modes:** app, viral, embed, kiosk + 4 token-gated modes

**Files Created:**
```
lib/layout/token-types.ts          (13 lines)  - UserTokens interface, TokenId type
lib/layout/token-detector.ts       (68 lines)  - Token source adapter + getUserTokens()
lib/auth/isAuthenticated.ts        (32 lines)  - Auth helpers (getCurrentWallet, isAuthenticated)
```

**Files Modified:**
```
lib/layout/mode-detector.ts        - Added 4 token-gated modes + detection logic
lib/layout/useLayoutMode.ts        - Accept userTokens parameter
```

**Token Unlock Conditions:**
```typescript
vip:          owns 'networking-goat@1' NFT
civic-leader: trustLevel >= 9
collector:    nfts.length >= 10
premium:      memberships includes 'PRO_ANNUAL'
```

**Shell Components Created:**
```
components/layout/VIPShell.tsx          (36 lines)  - Gold gradient + 🐐 badge
components/layout/CivicLeaderShell.tsx  (36 lines)  - Blue gradient + ⭐ badge
components/layout/CollectorShell.tsx    (39 lines)  - Pink gradient + 💎 badge
components/layout/PremiumShell.tsx      (36 lines)  - Green gradient + ✨ badge
```

**Tests:**
```
lib/layout/__tests__/token-gated-modes.test.ts (120 lines)
- 8 test cases covering all mode detection scenarios
- Prioritization logic validation
- Auth requirement enforcement
```

---

### 2. Mode Shell Integration
**Commit:** `31d94a2` - feat: wire token-gated lenses into GenZ layout

**Central Switcher:**
```
components/layout/ModeShell.tsx (77 lines)
- Routes to appropriate shell based on detected mode
- Passes collectionCount to CollectorShell
- Handles all 8 modes with fallback to AppShell
```

**Reusable Navigation:**
```
components/layout/AppNav.tsx (58 lines)
- Tab navigation for authenticated shells
- Friends | Circle | Signals tabs
- Active state with GenZ neon styling
```

**Integration:**
- Wired `ModeShell` into `app/(tabs)/layout.tsx`
- Client-side mode detection with `useLayoutMode` hook
- Token detection stubbed for demo (ready for real service integration)

---

### 3. Gamified Unlock System (Phase 4)
**Commit:** `bf4f9e5` - feat: add unlock system with progress HUD and celebration modal

**Progress HUD:**
```
components/gating/TokenGatedProgress.tsx (44 lines)
- Fixed bottom-right floating panel
- Shows progress toward Collector (x/10 NFTs)
- Shows progress toward Civic Leader (x/9 trust)
- Visual progress bars with percentage fill
- Only visible when authenticated
```

**Unlock Celebrations:**
```
components/gating/UnlockModal.tsx (80 lines)
- Confetti animation (2 bursts using canvas-confetti)
- Mode-specific titles & perks list
- Glass morphism modal with backdrop blur
- One-time per device (localStorage tracking)
```

**Upgrade Detection:**
```
lib/layout/useModeUpgrade.ts (53 lines)
- Tracks highest rank seen via localStorage
- Compares current mode to previous rank
- Fires upgrade event only on rank increase
- Provides resetProgress() for testing
```

**Mode Rank System:**
```
app/viral/embed/kiosk:  0 (baseline)
collector:              1 (10+ NFTs)
civic-leader/premium:   2 (trust 9/9 or PRO membership)
vip:                    3 (legendary GOAT NFT)
```

**Mapping:**
```
lib/layout/upgrade-map.ts (11 lines)
- Maps LayoutMode to unlock modal type
- Enables mode-specific celebration messages
```

---

### 4. Universal Bottom Navigation
**Commit:** `d297936` - refactor: universal bottom nav across all modes

**Problem Solved:**
- Eliminated duplicate navigation chrome across modes
- Unified muscle memory for tab positions
- Reduced code duplication (single source of truth)

**Implementation:**
```
components/layout/BottomNav.tsx (73 lines)
- Universal tabs: Friends | Circle | Signals
- Shown in all modes except embed
- Unauth users route to /onboard (gentle conversion)
- GenZ neon styling (#00F6FF cyan)
```

**Architecture:**
- Moved nav rendering into `ModeShell` (centralized)
- Removed `AppNav` from token-gated shells (no double chrome)
- Nav automatically shown/hidden based on mode

**Benefits:**
- Add 4th tab? Change one file
- Consistent UX across all lenses
- Public → auth gradient (viral shows nav but gates clicks)

---

### 5. Demo Mode & Polish
**Commit:** `ed4a81c` - demo: enable test mode for token-gated lenses

**Stubbed Auth:**
```typescript
// app/(tabs)/layout.tsx
setIsAuthenticated(true)  // Demo mode enabled
```

**Token Stubs:**
```typescript
// Test Collector mode (active by default)
setUserTokens({
  nfts: Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => `nft-${i}`),
  badges: [],
  memberships: [],
  trustLevel: 5
})
```

**Commented Examples:**
- VIP mode test (networking-goat@1)
- Civic Leader test (trustLevel: 9)
- Premium test (PRO_ANNUAL membership)
- Instructions for switching modes

---

### 6. Cleanup & Bug Fixes

**Wallet UI Removal:**
**Commit:** `3f2a6d0` - remove: wallet UI components entirely
```
- Deleted WalletFloatingButton.tsx (72 lines)
- Deleted app/(tabs)/wallet/page.tsx (427 lines)
- Kept core wallet functions as stubs for future integration
```

**Syntax Fix:**
**Commit:** `759f5d0` - fix: HCSAssetCollectionService class structure
```
- Fixed duplicate closing brace in HCSAssetCollectionService
- Private methods now properly inside class scope
- Resolved /signals build error
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Quick Mode Switch
**File:** `app/(tabs)/layout.tsx` (lines 42-71)

**Test VIP:**
```typescript
setUserTokens({
  nfts: ['networking-goat@1'],
  badges: [],
  memberships: [],
  trustLevel: 5
})
```

**Test Civic Leader:**
```typescript
setUserTokens({
  nfts: [],
  badges: [],
  memberships: [],
  trustLevel: 9
})
```

**Test Premium:**
```typescript
setUserTokens({
  nfts: [],
  badges: [],
  memberships: ['PRO_ANNUAL'],
  trustLevel: 5
})
```

**Test Collector:**
```typescript
setUserTokens({
  nfts: Array.from({ length: 10 }, (_, i) => `nft-${i}`),
  badges: [],
  memberships: [],
  trustLevel: 5
})
```

### Reset Progress
```javascript
// Browser console
localStorage.removeItem('tm-last-mode-rank')
```
Clears unlock history so modal fires again.

### Test Matrix
```
Routes to test:
- /contacts    ✓ All modes render correctly
- /signals     ✓ All modes render correctly  
- /inner-circle ✓ All modes render correctly

Features to verify:
- Mode badge shows in header
- Bottom nav persists across modes
- Progress HUD updates dynamically
- Unlock modal fires once per rank
- Confetti animation plays
- Navigation tabs remain clickable
```

async getUserNFTs(wallet) {
  // TODO: Wire to hcsAssetCollection.getUserCollection(wallet)
  return []  // Currently stubbed
}

async getTrustLevel(wallet) {
  // TODO: Wire to trustAllocationService.getCircleSize(wallet)
  return 0   // Currently stubbed
}

## 📝 Key Decisions & Rationale

### 1. Client-Side Token Detection
**Why:** Zero backend changes required, instant mode switching, easier testing
**Trade-off:** Token data fetched on mount (acceptable for demo, optimize later)

### 2. localStorage for Upgrade Tracking
**Why:** Persistent across sessions, simple API, no server state needed
**Trade-off:** Per-device (not per-user), but appropriate for celebration UX

### 3. Rank-Based Priority System
**Why:** Clear hierarchy prevents ambiguous states, simple to reason about
**Implementation:** `vip (3) > civic-leader/premium (2) > collector (1) > app (0)`

### 4. Universal Bottom Nav in ModeShell
**Why:** Single source of truth, muscle memory, no duplicate chrome
**Trade-off:** Nav always shows (even in viral), but routes unauth to /onboard

### 5. Separate Shell Components
**Why:** Clean separation of concerns, easy to customize per mode
**Trade-off:** More files, but better maintainability and testability

### 6. Confetti Library (canvas-confetti)
**Why:** Lightweight (11KB), battle-tested, zero config
**Alternative considered:** Custom CSS animations (more work, less polish)

---

## 🎓 Architecture Highlights

### Separation of Concerns
```
Detection Logic:  mode-detector.ts   (pure functions, testable)
Token Fetching:   token-detector.ts  (adapter pattern, mockable)
UI Shells:        *Shell.tsx         (presentational, mode-specific)
Navigation:       BottomNav.tsx      (universal, mode-agnostic)
Progression:      useModeUpgrade.ts  (hook, localStorage-based)
```

### Progressive Enhancement
```
Level 0: viral/embed/kiosk (public, no auth)
Level 1: app (authenticated, basic features)
Level 2: collector (10+ NFTs, collection UX)
Level 3: civic-leader/premium (parallel tier, trust or membership)
Level 4: vip (legendary NFT, ultimate access)
```

### Mode Composition
```
mode-detector.ts     → detects mode based on context
useLayoutMode.ts     → React hook wrapper for client components
ModeShell.tsx        → routes to appropriate shell + renders nav
*Shell.tsx           → mode-specific chrome + gradient + badge
BottomNav.tsx        → universal navigation across all modes
```

## 🐛 Bugs Fixed

### Issue #1: Duplicate Closing Brace
**File:** `lib/services/HCSAssetCollectionService.ts`
**Error:** `Expression expected` at line 305 (private method)
**Cause:** Class closed early with `}` at line 300, leaving methods orphaned
**Fix:** Removed duplicate brace, methods now inside class scope
**Impact:** /signals page now loads correctly

### Issue #2: Double Navigation Chrome
**File:** Token-gated shells (VIP, Civic Leader, etc.)
**Issue:** AppNav in header + BottomNav in footer = double chrome
**Fix:** Removed AppNav from shell headers, centralized nav in ModeShell
**Impact:** Clean, consistent UX across all modes
