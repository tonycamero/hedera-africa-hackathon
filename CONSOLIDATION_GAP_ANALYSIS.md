---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- ✅ All 3 personas work from one codebase
- ✅ Persona switch via env var only (no rebuild)
- ✅ No code duplication
- ✅ Bundle size < 500KB per persona
- ✅ Test coverage > 70%

### Business Metrics
- ✅ Demo all 3 personas in 1 hour
- ✅ Deploy to 3 markets simultaneously
- ✅ Maintain 1 codebase (not 4)
- ✅ Add new personas in < 1 week

---

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Universal Recognition V2 already in Civic (no merge conflicts)
- GenZ features already in Civic (no porting needed)
- Civic API routes most comprehensive (no conflicts)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Metallic theme may conflict with glass morphism (mitigation: separate theme files)
- Professional recognition tokens different structure (mitigation: normalize to common schema)
- Page routing may need refactoring (mitigation: gradual migration)

### High Risk ❌
- None identified

---

## Rollback Plan

If consolidation fails at any phase:

```bash
# Return to Civic lens
git checkout feat/civic-lens

# Or use backup tag
git checkout backup-civic-20251023

# Cherry-pick specific working commits
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

All branch backups tagged before consolidation work begins.

---

## Conclusion

**Bottom Line:**
- Start with Civic (has 80% of what we need)
- Port 20% from Professional (themes, tokens, components)
- Configure personas (1 codebase → 3 markets)
- Ship in 12 days (vs 18-21 originally estimated)

**Key Insight:**
Universal Recognition V2 is already the foundation of Civic. We're not merging 4 branches - we're **adding Professional features to Civic's Universal Recognition base**.
