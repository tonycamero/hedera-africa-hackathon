**Steps:**
1. Click header lens switcher
2. Click on "üî• GenZ" (already owned)
3. No modal appears
4. Page reloads
5. Header shows "üî• GenZ" as active

**Expected Result:**

- Page reload applies new lens theme

**Check Logs:**
```
[set-lens] Switched to genz for <accountId>

### 7. Persistence Check
**Goal:** Verify lens state persists across sessions

**Steps:**
1. Note current active lens
2. Refresh page (F5)
3. Check header lens switcher

**Expected Result:**
- Active lens remains the same after refresh
- Owned lenses list unchanged

**Alternative:** Close browser tab, reopen app, verify state

---

### 8. Balance Verification (Future)
**Goal:** Verify TRST balance reflects lens unlock costs

**Current State:** Balance display not yet implemented (Step 10)

**Future Test:**
- Initial stipend: 1.35 TRST
- After unlocking one additional lens: 0.35 TRST remaining
- After unlocking second additional lens: -0.65 TRST (should be blocked)

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Unauthorized" errors
- Verify Magic token is fresh (tokens expire quickly)
- Check browser console for auth errors
- Re-login if needed

### Lens state not persisting
- Check that `profileStore` is working (in-memory for now)
- Verify API responses include `owned` and `active` arrays
- Check browser console for fetch errors

### Unlock modal doesn't appear
- Check that `LensUnlockModal` component exists at `components/lens/LensUnlockModal.tsx`
- Verify lens prices in `lib/lens/lensConfig.ts`
- Check browser console for component errors

### Theme not changing after lens switch
- Verify page reload happens after lens switch
- Check that `LensProvider` is mounted in app layout
- Inspect `<html>` element for theme class
