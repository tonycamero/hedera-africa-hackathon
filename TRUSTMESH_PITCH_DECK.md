# TrustMesh Pitch Deck
## Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025

---

## **Slide 1: Title & Vision**

### **TrustMesh**
**Portable, programmable trust for excluded economies**

*Think: Pokémon GO meets LinkedIn meets actual money.*

## **Slide 2: The Problem**

### **The Trust Gap**

**Africa's 500M students have trust — but institutions can't see it.**

- **400M+ Africans** excluded from digital commerce
- Zero credit history, zero verified skills
- Informal trust exists but isn't portable
- No access to loans, jobs, or economic opportunity

**Quantified Impact:**
- $180B annual GDP lost to trust-based exclusion
- 70% informal workforce with no digital identity
- Traditional credit systems exclude entire economies

*What if trust could move with you?*

---

## **Slide 3: The Solution (The Hook)**

### **TrustMesh: Trust That Travels**

**Portable, programmable trust built on-chain.**

Three-layer system that creates real economic value:

1. **Contacts** (unlimited): QR-based instant bonding
2. **Circle of 9** (scarce): Strategic trust allocations (25 TRST each)
3. **Recognition Signals** (84+ types): Peer/institutional endorsements

**The Innovation:**
- Bounded dynamics prevent gaming (O(n) not O(n²))
- 0.01 TRST micro-fees enable viral adoption
- Sub-2s consensus creates real-time feedback loops

*Recognition NFTs + Circle of 9 + TRST economy = spendable reputation*

---

## **Slide 4: Why Hedera? (Technical & Strategic Advantage)**

### **Beyond Speed and Cost**

**ABFT Finality:**
- Trust relationships can't be manipulated retroactively
- Immutable audit trail for compliance and research
- Mathematical certainty for bounded trust systems

**Predictable Economics:**
- Sub-$0.01 fees enable high-frequency social actions
- 0.01 TRST per mint sustainable even at 100M users
- No gas price spikes killing viral mechanics

**Governance & ESG:**
- Decentralized council prevents platform capture
- Carbon-negative consensus aligns with African values
- Hedera's regulatory clarity enables institutional adoption

**Strategic Fit for Africa:**
- Mobile-first architecture works on feature phones
- Low bandwidth requirements for rural connectivity
- Local validator nodes enable sovereign infrastructure

*Hedera isn't just faster—it's the only network where bounded trust systems can scale economically.*

## **Slide 5: Market & Opportunity (TAM/SAM/SOM)**

### **The Underbanked Majority**

**Total Addressable Market (TAM): $2.3B**
- Africa fintech market, 25% annual growth
- 400M+ excluded adults without financial access
- 150M SMBs need trust verification for trade

**Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): $850M**
- University students (27M across Africa)
- Young professionals entering workforce
- Cross-border traders and gig workers

**Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $120M (Year 1-3)**
- 4 pilot universities, 100K students initially
- Campus-to-campus viral growth (referral mechanics)
- Expand to professional networks and SMB trade

**Local Market Insight:**
- 70% of African workforce is informal—no credit history
- Mobile money adoption at 50%+ (ready for TRST)
- Youth-dominant demographics (median age 19) = viral potential

## **Slide 6: Business & Revenue Model**

### **Pure Token Economy**

**The Genius of 0.01 TRST per Mint:**

```
27 Free Mints (onboarding gift)
  ↓
Declining Balance (creates urgency)
  ↓  
0.01 TRST per Additional Mint
  ↓
Viral Collection Mechanics (Pokémon-style)
  ↓
Network Effects
```

**Who Pays:** Users (micro-fees), Universities (bulk TRST), Employers (verification access)

**Pricing Mechanism:**
- Recognition mints: 0.01 TRST (feels free, aggregates meaningfully)
- Trust allocations: 25 TRST (strategic scarcity)
- Bulk campus purchases: Volume discounts for student programs

**Financial Flow:**
- User → Recognition mint → 0.01 TRST burned → Protocol revenue
- Campus → Bulk TRST purchase → Student engagement funding
- Employer → Credential verification → Access fees

**Scale Economics:**
- 100K users × 10 mints/mo = $10K monthly, $120K/year
- 1M users = $1.2M/year
- 10M users = $12M/year
- 100M users = $120M/year

## **Slide 7: Tokenomics & Community**

### **TRST: Utility Token for Trust Economy**

**Token Properties:**
- **Total Supply:** Managed supply (burns via mints)
- **Utility:** Recognition minting, trust allocations, unlock mechanics
- **Distribution Model:**
  - Team: 15% (4-year vesting)
  - Campus programs: 30%
  - User rewards: 25%
  - Reserve: 30%

**Governance:**
- Recognition signal catalog updates via community vote
- Trust mechanics parameter adjustments
- Campus program funding allocation

**Community Growth Strategy:**
- Campus ambassador programs (refer 50 students → bonus TRST)
- Faculty validation rewards (institutional trust signals)
- Event organizer perks (QR check-in rewards)
- Research data access (anonymized, IRB-compliant)

**Network Effects:**
- More users → more recognition signals → more valuable collection
- More campuses → cross-institutional portability
- More trust data → better economic opportunity matching
