## üí° Implementation Notes

### Seed Script Pattern:
```typescript
const CANONICAL_SIGNALS_V2 = [
  {
    type_id: "strategic-visionary@2",
    category: "professional",
    subcategory: "leadership",
    name: "Strategic Visionary",
    description: "Exceptional ability to see the big picture and guide long-term strategy",
    trustValue: 0.5,
    rarity: "legendary",
    icon: "üéØ",
    tags: ["leadership", "strategy", "vision", "planning"],
    v: 2
  },
  // ... 83 more signals
];

export async function seedRecognitionCatalogV2() {
  const topic = topics().recognition;
  
  for (const signal of CANONICAL_SIGNALS_V2) {
    const payload = {
      v: 2,
      type: "CATALOG_UPSERT",
      origin: "seed_v2",
      signal,
      iat: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
      metadata: {
        seededAt: new Date().toISOString(),
        version: "2.0.0",
        idempotent: true,
        content_hash: hashSignal(signal)
      }
    };
    
    await submitToTopic(topic, JSON.stringify(payload));
  }
}
```

## üìä Trust Economics

### Value Hierarchy:
- **0.5** (Legendary): Transformative impact, rare demonstrations
- **0.4** (Rare): Significant contributions, consistent excellence
- **0.3** (Common): Foundational behaviors, regular positive actions
- **0.2** (Common): Entry-level recognition, building blocks

### Comparative Economics:
- Contact Token = 1.0 (professional connection)
- Circle of 9 = 27.0 each (inner trust circle, 243 total)
- Recognition Signals = 0.2-0.5 (micro-endorsements)

**Recognition accumulation**: 100 common signals (0.3 avg) = 30 trust units = ~30 professional connections worth of social proof

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Generate Full JSON Catalog**: Export all 84 signals with complete v2 metadata
2. **Create Seed Endpoint**: `/api/admin/seed-catalog-v2` with idempotent logic
3. **Update UI Filters**: Add Civic category to `/recognition` and `/collections`
4. **Migrate Existing**: Map old 53 tokens to new v2 IDs where overlap exists
5. **HCS Publish**: Write full catalog to recognition topic with CATALOG_UPSERT events
