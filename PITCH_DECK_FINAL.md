# **TrustMesh Pitch Deck**

## **Hedera Africa Hackathon 2025**

---

## **Slide 1: The Trust Gap**

**Africa's students have trust â€” but institutions can't see it.**

* 500M students, zero credit history  
* Informal trust exists but isn't portable  
* No verified skills, no access to loans or jobs

*What if trust could move with you?*

---

## **Slide 2: Introducing TrustMesh**

**Portable, programmable trust built on-chain.**

* Recognition NFTs from peers, professors, orgs  
* Circle of 9 creates scarcity and signal value  
* Trust score updates in real time

*Built on Hedera for speed, cost, and transparency.*

---

## **Slide 3: What Students Can Do**

**One simple interface to build and share trust.**

* Send signals â†’ mint recognition (0.01 TRST)  
* Allocate trust to close peers (Circle of 9\)  
* Export Flex Portfolio (QR \+ PDF)  
* Click to verify on HashScan

*135 free mints to start. Then 0.01 TRST each.*

---

## **Slide 4: Campus-First Strategy**

**Trust networks form naturally at universities.**

* Peer signals \+ faculty validation  
* Local viral loops via referrals  
* No surveillance, just attestations

*We start small, grow wide.*

---

## **Slide 5: Amara's Journey**

**A student in Ghana turns trust into opportunity.**

* Earns badges from events, professors  
* Builds Circle of 9  
* Applies for internship with verified credentials  
* Refers friends â†’ her network grows

*Trust becomes spendable reputation.*

---

## **Slide 6: Why Now?**

**Africa can leapfrog legacy systems.**

* 70% informal workforce  
* Mobile-first, youth-dominant (median age 19\)  
* $2.3B fintech \+ alt-credit market

*The infrastructure is behind. The trust isn't.*

---

## **Slide 7: Why Hedera?**

**ABFT finality prevents retroactive trust manipulation.**

* Sub-$0.01 fees enable viral social mechanics  
* Carbon-negative consensus aligns with African values  
* Governance prevents platform capture

*Hedera isn't just fasterâ€”it's the only network where bounded trust systems scale economically.*

---

## **Slide 8: Roadmap**

**From campus to credit to commerce.**

* **Now:** Targeting \>3 pilot universities  
* **Next:** Employer-facing verifications  
* **Future:** Credit scoring \+ remittance trust

*Start with students. Scale to the continent.*

---

## **Slide 9: Early Traction**

**67 days, 300+ commits, production-ready.**

* \~125K lines of code  
* HCS-22 identity binding (FIRST ecosystem implementation)  
* 84 Recognition Signals in 5 categories  
* 53 Gen-Z hashinal cards and **viral *boost*** mechanisms  
* Sub-2s consensus validated

*Aspirational but already in motion.*

---

## **Slide 10: Build the Reputation Layer for Africa**

**Trust is a currency. Let's make it spendable.**

* Open to pilots, research partners, early funders  
* Unlock reputation in places data can't reach

**CTA: Join us â€” trust that travels.** ðŸ”¥

## **A1: Business Model Detail**

**Pure token economy: 0.01 TRST per recognition mint.**

* **Who Pays:** Users (micro-fees), Universities (bulk TRST), Employers (verification)  
* **Pricing:** 135 free mints \= $1.35 CAC, then 0.01 TRST each  
* **Scale:** 100K users \= $120K/yr | 10M users \= $12M/yr

**Financial Flow:**

* User â†’ Mint â†’ 0.01 TRST burned â†’ Protocol revenue  
* Campus â†’ Bulk purchase â†’ Student engagement  
* Employer â†’ Credential access â†’ Verification fees

---

## **A2: Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)**

**Total Addressable Market: $2.3B**

* Africa fintech, 25% annual growth  
* 400M+ excluded adults, 150M SMBs

**Serviceable Addressable: $850M**

* 27M university students across Africa  
* Young professionals, cross-border traders

**Serviceable Obtainable: $120M (Yr 1-3)**

* 4 pilot universities, 100K students initially  
* Campus-to-campus viral growth

---

## **A3: Tokenomics**

**TRST: Utility stablecoin for TrustMesh economy.**

- **USD-backed:** 1:1 peg, fungible/redeemable
- **Utility:** Micropayments per recognition mint (0.01 TRST)
- **Onboarding:** 135 free TRST ($1.35 CAC)
- **Top-up:** HBAR or USDC â†’ instant TRST conversion
* Campus program funding
