# TrustMesh Architecture Manifesto
## The Sovereignty-First Social Infrastructure

---

## 🛡️ **Core Manifesto**

**TrustMesh is not another social media platform.**  
**TrustMesh is the infrastructure for post-surveillance capitalism.**

### **The Promise We Make:**
1. **Your data, your keys, your control** — No exceptions
2. **Consent required for every data access** — Zero unauthorized processing  
3. **Zero-knowledge proofs for aggregate queries** — Privacy-preserving analytics
4. **No centralized PII databases** — HashSphere nodes only
5. **User-controlled data processing** — You run your own node or choose who does
6. **Open source consent management** — Transparent, auditable, forkable

### **What We Reject:**
- ❌ Surveillance capitalism business models
- ❌ Scraping user data without explicit consent  
- ❌ Centralized indexing of private information
- ❌ Platform-controlled social graphs
- ❌ Ad-revenue models that commoditize users
- ❌ "Free" services that sell user attention

## 🏗️ **Technical Architecture Principles**

### **1. Blockchain as Source of Truth**
```typescript
// Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) as immutable ledger
interface TrustMeshTransaction {
  type: 'TRUST_ALLOCATE' | 'CONTACT_ACCEPT' | 'RECOGNITION_MINT'
  from: PublicIdentifier        // Never contains PII
  to: PublicIdentifier          // Never contains PII  
  encryptedPayload: string      // AES-256 encrypted with user keys
  consentHash: string           // Hash of required consent
  zkProof?: ZeroKnowledgeProof  // Optional privacy proof
  timestamp: UnixTimestamp      // Consensus timestamp from HCS
}
```

### **2. HashSphere Node Architecture**
```
Personal HashSphere Node (User-Controlled)
├── 🔐 Private key management (user holds keys)
├── 🔓 Selective decryption based on consent
├── 📊 Zero-knowledge proof generation  
├── 🤝 P2P data sharing (consent-gated)
├── 🛡️ Consent management interface
└── 📡 HCS message processing

Enterprise HashSphere Node (Organization-Controlled)
├── 🏢 Team/enterprise data processing
├── 📋 Compliance-gated data access
├── 📝 Immutable audit trails
├── 🔌 Enterprise system integration
└── 👥 Multi-user consent management
```

### **3. Consent-First Data Processing**
```typescript
// NO data processing without explicit user consent
export async function processUserData(request: DataAccessRequest) {
  // 1. Verify requester identity
  const requester = await verifyDigitalSignature(request.signature)
  
  // 2. Check active consent
  const consent = await getUserConsent(request.userId, requester.id, request.dataType)
  if (!consent || consent.expired || !consent.covers(request.operation)) {
    throw new ConsentError('User has not consented to this data access')
  }
  
  // 3. Process only within consent scope
  return await processWithinScope(request, consent.scope)
}
```

## 💰 **Business Model: Privacy as Premium**

### **Revenue Streams (Privacy-Preserving)**
1. **HashSphere Node Hosting** — Managed nodes for non-technical users
2. **Enterprise Compliance Tools** — Audit trails, regulatory reporting
3. **Zero-Knowledge Analytics** — Aggregate insights without privacy violation
4. **Consent Management Platform** — B2B consent infrastructure
5. **Privacy-First Integration APIs** — Developer tools for sovereign apps

### **What We Will NEVER Do:**
- ❌ Sell user data to advertisers
- ❌ Profile users for targeting
- ❌ Create addictive engagement loops
- ❌ Monetize user attention
- ❌ Build surveillance infrastructure

## 🔬 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Encryption Schema**
```typescript
interface EncryptedMessage {
  publicMetadata: {
    from: PublicIdentifier    // Public account ID only
    to: PublicIdentifier      // Public account ID only
    type: MessageType         // TRUST_ALLOCATE, CONTACT_ACCEPT, etc.
    timestamp: number         // Consensus timestamp
  }
  encryptedPayload: {
    data: string              // AES-256-GCM encrypted PII
    salt: string              // Unique salt per message
    consentRequired: string[] // List of consent types needed to decrypt
  }
  zkProof?: {
    type: 'trust_level' | 'reputation' | 'network_size'
    proof: string             // zk-SNARK proof
    publicSignals: string[]   // Public verifiable outputs
  }
}
```

### **Consent Management**
```typescript
interface ConsentRecord {
  id: string                  // Unique consent ID
  grantor: PublicIdentifier   // User granting consent
  grantee: PublicIdentifier   // Entity receiving consent
  dataTypes: string[]         // Types of data covered
  operations: string[]        // Allowed operations (read, aggregate, share)
  purpose: string             // Human-readable purpose
  expiration: Date            // When consent expires
  scope: ConsentScope         // Specific limitations
  revocable: boolean          // Can be revoked by user
  signature: DigitalSignature // Cryptographic proof of consent
}
```

### **Zero-Knowledge Query Engine**
```typescript
export class ZKQueryEngine {
  // "How many people have trust level > 7?" without revealing who or actual levels
  async queryTrustDistribution(threshold: number): Promise<ZKProofResult> {
    const circuit = await this.loadCircuit('trust_threshold')
    const witnesses = await this.collectWitnesses('trust_allocations')
    return circuit.prove({ threshold, witnesses })
  }
  
  // "What's the average reputation in tech sector?" without exposing individuals  
  async queryReputationByCategory(category: string): Promise<ZKProofResult> {
    const circuit = await this.loadCircuit('reputation_average')
    const witnesses = await this.collectWitnesses('user_profiles', { category })
    return circuit.prove({ category, witnesses })
  }
}
```

## 🚨 **Red Lines (Never Cross)**

### **Technical Red Lines:**
1. **Never store PII in plaintext** — Even encrypted at rest isn't enough
2. **Never process data without consent** — No exceptions for "anonymous" analytics
3. **Never centralize user private keys** — Users must control their own keys
4. **Never build surveillance infrastructure** — Even for "good" purposes

### **Business Red Lines:**
1. **Never sell user data** — Not aggregated, not "anonymous", never
2. **Never accept surveillance advertising** — No targeted ads based on user data
3. **Never build addiction mechanisms** — No engagement optimization for time-on-site
4. **Never compromise on consent** — User can revoke any permission anytime

---

## 📊 **Success Metrics (Privacy-Aligned)**

### **Technical Metrics:**
- **Zero PII leaks** — Automated scanning for accidental plaintext storage
- **Consent coverage** — 100% of data processing covered by active consent
- **Decryption performance** — <100ms response time for authorized queries
- **Node uptime** — 99.9% availability for personal HashSphere nodes

### **Business Metrics:**
- **Privacy premium adoption** — % users choosing paid privacy vs free alternatives
- **Enterprise compliance** — Number of regulated industries using TrustMesh
- **Developer ecosystem** — Apps built on consent-first infrastructure
- **User retention** — Not engagement time, but long-term trust and usage

### **Social Impact Metrics:**
- **Data breaches prevented** — Zero breaches possible with proper encryption
- **Surveillance reduction** — Measurable decrease in user tracking across ecosystem
- **Consent education** — User understanding of data rights and consent
- **Regulatory innovation** — Influence on privacy legislation and standards

## 🔮 **Future Vision**

**By 2027:**
- Every user runs their own HashSphere node (or chooses a trusted provider)
- Zero-knowledge social analytics are the industry standard
- Consent management is built into the OS level
- Surveillance capitalism is recognized as a historical anomaly
- TrustMesh infrastructure powers privacy-first social apps globally

**By 2030:**
- Personal data sovereignty is a fundamental human right
- All social platforms are required to offer consent-first architectures
- Users are paid for their data contributions through transparent mechanisms
- Privacy-preserving computation enables population-scale insights without surveillance
- TrustMesh has proven that profitable, privacy-first social infrastructure is not only possible, but inevitable

**This manifesto serves as our North Star. Every technical decision, every business choice, every feature addition must align with these principles. We are building the future of social infrastructure, not optimizing the surveillance capitalism of the past.**
